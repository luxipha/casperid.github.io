## 5. Data Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Blockchain data cannot be deleted once recorded.

## 6. Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your information, including:

* Encryption at rest and in transit
* Secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., passkeys, cryptographic signatures)
* Access controls and audit logging

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Your information may be processed or stored in jurisdictions different from your place of residence. We take reasonable steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place for cross-border data transfers.
